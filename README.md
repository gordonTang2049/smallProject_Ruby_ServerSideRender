This repo is all my small projects that using Ruby Sinatra as serverside framework and website are rendered by it.

## AKB48 website 


    This project is to build a small fan club website for a popular Japanese Singing group AKB48.

## ForceLinker 

    ForceLinker is a social media CRUD app, users would post their life or short term goal,

    and also has a process thead that they can posting their process actiivty every day.

## Movie 1 and 3

    This app would connect to omdb API and display the movie information.

    Movie 3 is a reinforce version that will store some information in my own Database.
    It would speed up the query and reduce time of using OMDB API.
